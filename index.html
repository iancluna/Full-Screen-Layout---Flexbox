            Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
            It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life. ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
            He could actually save people from death?
            The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
